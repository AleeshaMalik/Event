# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards others.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being patient with new contributors and learners.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome advances or attention.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers are also responsible for communicating with a project's community members to address issues that arise.

## Consequences

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [email address]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. 

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
